BLOOM’sdevelopmentwascoordinatedbyBigScience, an openresearch collaboration whose goal was thepublic release of an LLM.
The project started after being awarded by GENCI a compute grant on its JeanZay supercomputer at IDRIS/CNRS.
It was initially built around a concerted effort from HuggingFace and the French NLP community (the“foundingmembers”),and quickly opened up to growintoabroaderinternational collaborationtosupportitsaimsoflinguistic,geographical,andscientificdiversity.In theend,over1200peopleregisteredasparticipantsinBigScienceandweregivenaccess toitscommunicationchannels.Theyhadbackgroundnotonlyinmachinelearningand computerscience,butalsolinguistics,statistics,socio-culturalanthropology,philosophy, law,andotherfields.Ofthose,hundredsofindividualshavedirectlycontributedtoone oftheproject’sreleasedartifacts.Whilethelargestnumberofparticipantsultimately originatedfromtheUS,38countrieswererepresented.
